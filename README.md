# Mini-project — Ensemble Learning

Short description
- Jupyter notebook implementing experiments on ensemble methods (Decision Tree, AdaBoost, MLP, Bagging, Random Forest) for wine/beer quality prediction.
- Main notebook: [Ensemble Learning.ipynb](Ensemble Learning.ipynb)

Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Main Python packages used in the notebook:
  - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, keras, openpyxl
- Quick install:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib keras openpyxl
```

How to run
1. Open [Ensemble Learning.ipynb](Ensemble Learning.ipynb) in Jupyter / JupyterLab / VSCode or Colab.
2. Make sure the dataset `beer_quality.xlsx` is in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Run cells sequentially.

Results summary
- The notebook prints/plots results and a final comparison table (accuracy / F1 / training & inference times).
